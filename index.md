## about me

Hi, I'm Laura Hetz, a doctoral student at [ETH Zürich](https://ethz.ch/en.html) with the [Applied Cryptography group](https://appliedcrypto.ethz.ch/).
My research interests lie in the design, evaluation, and implementation of privacy-enhancing technologies, and anonymous communication systems.

Before, I worked on unbalanced private set intersection in the context of [private mobile contact discovery](https://contact-discovery.github.io/) with [Christian Weinert](https://pure.royalholloway.ac.uk/en/persons/christian-weinert) and [Thomas Schneider](https://www.encrypto.cs.tu-darmstadt.de/team_encrypto/thomas_schneider/index.en.jsp) at the Technical University of Darmstadt.
